WoW Dings emoticons
===================

WoW Dings allows you to add funny symbols into your chat messages such as smilies, arrows, hearts etc. Just type the code corresponding to the symbol you want in your message, it will be automatically replaced. For example, `:)` will be replaced by `☺`, `(l)` will become `♥` and so on. Of course, other players do not need the addon to see the symbols you insert. However, the symbols may not be visible to players who have changed the default font of the game by another one that does not include the symbols.

Also works in Battle.net discussions.

Doesn't work for `/say`, `/yell` and `/raidwarning` messages.

Also implements the following macro shortcuts:
* `(here)` Name of your current location
* `(pin)` World map pin of your current location (WoW Retail only)
* `(t)` Detailed information about the targeted player

Type `/wd` to display the list of available symbols.
